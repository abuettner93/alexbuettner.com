abstract = "With rapid development of computerized healthcare, including the implementation of intraoperational sea-of-sensors monitoring systems, the increasing scale of oper- ational datasets is trending toward the use of automation as a primary tool for im- proved care. The development of automated data-mining techniques has increased dramatically over the last decade, and combined with a need for optimal resource allocation within clinical processes, healthcare research and development is moving toward personalized, highly dynamic patient care. Solutions to many target issues in healthcare are dependent on the ability to identify underlying patterns of a dynamic process, determine a useful characterization of the noisy or sparse data, and implementing personalized changes to better benefit the patient. In the past, many efforts in the field of clinical optimization have focused on frequentist scheduling models to better understand and optimize clinical processes. These methods rely on fixed statistical estimators to best predict flow patterns, but lack the ability to adapt to sudden changes in an care setting. Disease outbreaks, emergencies, and other unpredictable events may potentially cause traditional models to fail. Adaptive clinical process optimization has become an important field of study in recent years, as increased patient loads and health costs have begun to affect the quality of care in many medical practices. Modeling of clinical processes as stochastic flow models has gained popularity in recent decades, with big-data style analytics becoming a new frontier in optimization."
