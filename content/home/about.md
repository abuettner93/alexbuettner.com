# About me

I am currently a graduate student in Chemical Engineering at the <a href = "https://www.unr.edu">University of Nevada, Reno (UNR)</a> in Reno, Nevada. 


<!-- 
I earned my doctorate in chemical engineering with emphasis in thermodynamics, chemical process modeling & simulation. My current 
research involves the use of atomistic modeling methods to develop and understand new materials for extreme applications. For instance, 
the development of metal hexaborides, which are ceramics with unique mechanical and electronic properties; or development of reverse micellar systems for synthesis of nano-particles, are two examples of projects that we work on. We work in close collaboration with experimental groups at the University of California, San Diego and Alfred University.  We are also embarking on new modeling initiaves that involve the use of machine learning methods for various applications in process systems engineering 
including modeling of health care clinical operations for optimization and better understanding of risk.  

Our research is driven by the potential and opportunities that cutting edge modeling provide 
for development of new engineerng technologies. We continously publish in peer-reviewed journals, and present our work in many international 
and national conferences. I am an active participant in the organization of sessions in annual meetings for the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), Materials Research Society (MRS), and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). I am currently the 
adviser for the student local chapters of AIChE \& SHPE. I also work on mentoring of both graduate and 
undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds, and I have great interest in undergraduate STEM education for 
diverse student groups, in particular Hispanics. I am also engaged in various leadership 
roles with university committees, engineering accreditation, and community at large. For example, I served as the Northern Nevada Sierra Director  and member of the executive board for the AIChE NORCAL section from 2010 to 2017. I am very interested in fostering international 
collaborative research & teaching opportunities with countries in Latin America.
