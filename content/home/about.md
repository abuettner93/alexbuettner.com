# About me
I am currently employed as a data architech with PNC bank in the Birmingham, AL area. My role consists of administration of the Python Analytics Engine (PAE) with the bank, as well as performing ML engineering tasks to bring models into production environments. My day-to-day consists of maintaining user experience on the PAE platform, guiding my team as we move forward into the future, and ensuring we stay up to date with the latest technology and innovation.

In December of 2018 I earned my masters degree in chemical engineering from the <a href = "https://www.unr.edu">University of Nevada, Reno</a> in Reno, Nevada. My thesis is titled "Clinical Dataset Analysis and Patient Outcome Prediction via Machine Learning", which has enabled me to jump into the field of data science and data engineering, and begin my career in a new and exciting field.

My graduate research involved the study of clinical processes and their analysis/optimization via the use of machine learning. I am also working on the modernization of personalized health care in the form of patient-centered monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment. I have gained significant insight into applications of modern machine learning methods, including neural networks, Markov models, and Bayesian models, which I hope to apply in industry. In my undergraduate years I studied molecular dynamics and computational chemistry to better understand complex phenomena in reverse micelle systems (think soap bubbles), and how those systems could be used as nano-reactors in production environments.

In my spare time (as well as my research time) I do coding projects in Python and Linux environments. I have been an avid computer guy since I was 14 years old, and since then I have built my skills to serve my research and personal interests. I started coding in Python my freshman year of college, and since then have gotten quite comfortable with the ever-growing language. I often work on challenging math and science related problems for fun, and occasionally have cool or useful snippets of code as the result. Ranging from prime number studies to beating the stock market, I always find something interesting to code. I am currently working with a colleague to develop and platform for molecular modeling that is entirely open source; with the obvious caveat of that taking a lot of time and effort to produce. But all in a days work.


<!-- Though I am heavily involved in academic research and developing my career, I also enjoy doing many things outside of the office. Between downtown adventures and trips to Lake Tahoe, Reno has always given me something to do. Recently I took a trip to the lake for the fourth of July, and wow! Fireworks over the lake are my new favorite thing; especially while on a boat 300 yards from the fireworks barge! In the winter I love to ski and spend time up in the snow. When world class skiing is only an hour away, there really is no excuse!
